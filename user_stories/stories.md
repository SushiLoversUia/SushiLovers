jinho:
	As a student, sometimes i have to show my work to other people.
	I want to log in, out to webpage so that i can secure my presentation.
	I want to save, open, and delete presentations so that i can be able to use it again later.
	I want to be able to make slides and mange their orders so that i can separate the information and categorize them. 
	i want to be able to emphasize certain text and draw some figures so that i can transfer information 
	in better and understandable ways. 
	I want to put some img files in it because it is too complicated to draw it by myself.
	I want to put video files, or audio files so that i can explain my work more efficient ways.
	I want to be able to change themes such as dark, beach, modern, and sky so that i can make my presentation not boring
	and easy to catch.
	I want to have different modes when i show my presentation to other people so that they can only focus on my presentation.
