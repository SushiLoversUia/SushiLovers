As a student I sometimes need to present my homework or other tasks. My work is usually serval pages 
with different structure and headlines. The main feature is usually text and and figures, 
but sometimes I like to use videos as well. 

As an engineer I constantly have to present my work, so that my co-workers can understand my thoughts and 
vision, while working on different projects. To do this in a clear and an efficient way, 
I like to using both images and graphs, as much as text. Sometimes I also use animations.

As a kindergarden teacher I would like to present our activties for the parents, at the end of each semester. I want to show
imgages of activities with colorful headlines, drawings the children have made and videos.

As a girl in a wheel chair I would like to explain some of disabilites with my other pupils in a easy and colorful way,
so I they can understand my daily challanges.
