    As a student I sometimes need to present my homework or other tasks. My work is usually serval pages 
    with different structure and headlines. The main feature is usually text and and figures, 
    but sometimes I like to use videos as well. 

    As an engineer I constantly have to present my work, so that my co-workers can understand my thoughts and 
    vision, while working on different projects. To do this in a clear and an efficient way, 
    I like to using both images and graphs, as much as text. Sometimes I also use animations.

    so I they can understand my daily challanges.
